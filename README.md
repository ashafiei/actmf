Actor Multimedia Framework (actmf)
===============================

Actor Multimedia Framework (actmf) is an actor-based multimedia framework to build multimedia applications. An application consists of a number of components which together form a graph structure. Each component run as on an actor. There is an actor called environment which is responsible of creating components of an application as actors.


Folder structure
===================

Here is how the project is organized.

	build
	libactmf_core (core package)
	examples
	CMakeLists.txt
	LICENCE
	README.md
	actmf.kdev4

Installation
===============
```bash
  #!/bin/bash
  cd build
  ../cmake
  ./configure
  make
```
Before compilation make sure that actor_framework library is installed:

Development envirement
======================
Actor Multimedia Framework is configured to be developed under KDevelop IDE.
	
	kdevelop -p actmf.kdev4

Application development manual
===========

To create an application we need to create components, connect them together and sent them to the environment actor.

Here is an example with three components, a number generator, an addition filter, and a number display component:

```c++
  caf::actor env = caf::io::remote_actor("localhost", 5000);
  
  actmf::application app;
  actmf::component gen_num(std::string("gen_num"), actmf::gen_num::value);
  actmf::component addition(std::string("addition"), actmf::addition::value);
  actmf::component disp_num(std::string("disp_num"), actmf::disp_num::value);
  
  app.add_component(gen_num);
  app.add_component(addition);
  app.add_component(disp_num);
  
  app.add_link("gen_num", "addition");
  app.add_link("addition", "disp_num");
  
  caf::anon_send(env, actmf::create_app_atom::value, app);
  caf::await_all_actors_done();
  caf::shutdown();
```	

Actor development manual
=======================

Actor developers must implement new actors (components of application) in libactmf_core folder. An actor inherits from the actmf::abstract_actor class. Each actor must define ```addition_actor::awaiting_task``` as the initial behaviour of the actor.

Here is an example:

```c++

namespace actmf {
  
  class addition_actor : public actmf::abstract_actor
  {
  private:
  protected:
    virtual caf::behavior awaiting_task();
  public:
    addition_actor(const std::__cxx11::string& host, int16_t port) : abstract_actor(host, port) {};
    ~addition_actor() {}
  };
 
}

using namespace actmf;

caf::behavior addition_actor::awaiting_task()
{
    return {
      [=](add_atom add, int x, int y) {
	int res = x + y;
	for(remote_actor ract : next_actors)
	  this->send(ract.act, disp_num_atom::value, res);
      }
    };
}

```
